# Parallelize new models with USP provided by xDiT (text replica)

This tutorial focuses on utilizing USP (Unified Sequence Parallelism) in the context of the CogVideoX text-to-video model. USP combines two sequence parallelism methods such as ulysses attention and ring attention. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to apply USP to a new DiT model.

The diffusion process involves receiving Gaussian noise as input, iteratively predicting and denoising using the *CogVideoX Transformer*, and generating the output video. This process, typically executed on a single GPU within `diffusers`, is outlined in the following figure.

The Transformer's input comprises a text sequence, an image sequence, and an image rotary position embedding (RoPE). USP segments the input tensor along the sequence length dimension and assigns each segment to a GPU. Notably, the image sequence and the RoPE contains much more elements than the text sequence. Thus, two design choices emerge: 

- Split the text sequence, image sequence, and RoPE; or
- Split solely the image sequence and RoPE while each GPU retains a complete text sequence. 

The previous [tutorial](adding_model_usp.md) focus on the first situaion, while this tutorial will describe the second one.

As depicted in the subsequent diagram, USP harnesses multiple GPUs (2 in this instance) to execute diffusion. At the beginning of each iteration, USP segments the input image sequence and RoPE along the sequence length dimension, assigning each segment to a GPU. Additionally, the entire text seqeunce is also passed to all GPUs. As the input sequence gets partitioned, USP necessitates communication to facilitate attention computation within the transformer. Concluding the iteration, the two GPUs communicate via the `all_gather` primitive.

To accelerate CogVideoX inference using USP, four modifications to the original diffusion process are required. 

Firstly, the xDiT environment should be initialized at the beginning of the program. This requires several function such as `init_distributed_environment`, `initialize_model_parallel`, and `get_world_group` provided by xDiT. 

Secondly, in `diffusers`, the CogVideoX model is encapsulated within the `CogVideoXTransformer3DModel` class located at [diffusers/models/transformers/cogvideox_transformer_3d.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/transformers/cogvideox_transformer_3d.py), and it is reqired to split and merge seqeunces before and after the `forward` function of `CogVideoXTransformer3DModel`.

Thirdly, in `diffusers`, the attention computation is managed by the `CogVideoXAttnProcessor2_0` class in [`diffusers/models/attention_processor.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py). As shown at the top of the following figure, we need to replace the attention computation into the USP version provided by xDiT to achieve parallel computation. The bottom of the figure indicates that, the results obtained from both versions of attention computation are consistent.

Finally, as each GPU own a distict sequence segment, the patch embedding layer in [diffusers/models/embeddings.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/embeddings.py) need to be adapted.

## 1. Initialization

The initialization routine is the same as the [previous tutorial](adding_model_usp.md#1-initialization).

## 2. Splitting and Merging Sequences

The `forward` function of `CogVideoXTransformer3DModel` orchestrates the inference process for a single step iteration, outlined below:

```python
class CogVideoXTransformer3DModel(ModelMixin, ConfigMixin, PeftAdapterMixin):
    ...
    def forward(
        self,
        hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
        encoder_hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
        timestep: Union[int, float, torch.LongTensor],
        timestep_cond: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
        ofs: Optional[Union[int, float, torch.LongTensor]] = None,
        image_rotary_emb: Optional[Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]] = None,
        attention_kwargs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        return_dict: bool = True,
    )
```

To parallelize the inference process, we utilize `parallelize_transformer` on `pipe`. Within this function, a `new_forward` function is introduced with identical input and output parameters as the original function. The `new_forward` function performs the following steps:

- Splits the image sequence, and the RoPE based on the sequence length dimension, allocating each batch to a GPU.
- Executes the original forward process on all GPUs.
- Merges the predicted noise using all_gather.

The code snippet below demonstrates the utilization of `@functools.wraps` to decorate the new_forward function, ensuring that essential details such as the function name, docstring, and argument list are inherited from original_forward. As forward is a method of a class object, the `__get__` function is employed to set transformer as the initial argument for new_forward, subsequently assigning new_forward to transformer.forward.

```python
def parallelize_transformer(pipe: DiffusionPipeline):
    transformer = pipe.transformer
    original_forward = transformer.forward

    
    # definition of the new forward
    @functools.wraps(transformer.__class__.forward)
    def new_forward(...)
    
    new_forward = new_forward.__get__(transformer)
    transformer.forward = new_forward

parallelize_transformer(pipe)
```

In the input parameters, hidden_state, and image_rotary_emb represent the image sequence, and the RoPE, which are added to hidden_state respectively. These two tensors require splitting. The shapes of the two tensors are outlined in the table below. Note that, encoder_hidden_states represents the text sequence and does not need to be split. 

- `hidden_state` (batch_size, temporal_length, channels, height, width)
- `image_rotary_emb` (batch_size, rope_temporal_length, rope_height, rope_width, hidden_state)

In CogVideoX, `rope_height` and `rope_width` are half of `height` and `width` respectively. xDiT provides helper functions for USP, offering functionalities such as `get_sequence_parallel_rank()` and `get_sequence_parallel_world_size()` to access the number of GPUs and their respective ranks. The `get_sp_group()` function facilitates USP, incorporating an `all_gather()` operation to merge sequences after `forward`. When partitioning the text sequence by the text_length dimension and the image sequence and RoPE by the height dimension, the new forward function can be defined as follows:

```python
@functools.wraps(transformer.__class__.forward)
def new_forward(
    self,
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
    encoder_hidden_states: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
    timestep: torch.LongTensor = None,
    timestep_cond: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
    ofs: Optional[Union[int, float, torch.LongTensor]] = None,
    image_rotary_emb: Optional[Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]] = None,
    **kwargs,
):
    rope_h, rope_w = hidden_states.shape[-2] // 2, hidden_states.shape[-1] // 2

    # Step 1: split tensors
    hidden_states = torch.chunk(hidden_states, get_sequence_parallel_world_size(), dim=-2)[get_sequence_parallel_rank()]
    
    if image_rotary_emb is not None:
        freqs_cos, freqs_sin = image_rotary_emb
        dim_thw = freqs_cos.shape[-1]
        freqs_cos = freqs_cos.reshape(-1, rope_h, rope_w, dim_thw)
        freqs_cos = torch.chunk(freqs_cos, get_sequence_parallel_world_size(), dim=-3)[get_sequence_parallel_rank()]
        freqs_cos = freqs_cos.reshape(-1, dim_thw)
        
        freqs_sin = freqs_sin.reshape(-1, rope_h, rope_w, dim_thw)
        freqs_sin = torch.chunk(freqs_sin, get_sequence_parallel_world_size(), dim=-3)[get_sequence_parallel_rank()]
        freqs_sin = freqs_sin.reshape(-1, dim_thw)
        
        image_rotary_emb = (freqs_cos, freqs_sin)
    
    # Step 2: perform the original forward
    output = original_forward(
        hidden_states,
        encoder_hidden_states,
        timestep=timestep,
        timestep_cond=timestep_cond,
        ofs=ofs,
        image_rotary_emb=image_rotary_emb,
        **kwargs,
    )

    return_dict = not isinstance(output, tuple)
    sample = output[0]
    # Step 3: merge the output from two GPUs
    sample = get_sp_group().all_gather(sample, dim=-2)
    
    if return_dict:
        return output.__class__(sample, *output[1:])
    
    return (sample, *output[1:])
```


## 3. Attention with USP

Within `CogVideoXAttnProcessor2_0`, the `__call__` function concatenates the text and image sequences into a unified sequence. Subsequently, the function extracts `Q`, `K`, and `V` from this sequence and conducts the attention computation.

In our scenario, each GPU possesses an entire text sequence along with a portion of the image sequence. When the GPU concatenates these two sequences and derives `Q`, `K`, and `V` from the combined result, a direct usage of these values in USP isn't feasible due to the text sequence appearing multiple times. Fortunately, `xFuserLongContextAttention()` in xDiT accommodates this configuration. The function's signature is outlined below:

```python
class xFuserLongContextAttention(LongContextAttention):
    def forward(
        self, attn,
        query: Tensor,
        key: Tensor,
        value: Tensor,
        *,
        joint_tensor_query=None,
        joint_tensor_key=None,
        joint_tensor_value=None,
        ...
        joint_strategy="none",
        )
```

Within this function, query, key, and value correspond to Q, K, and V derived from the image sequence segment, while joint_tensor_query, joint_tensor_key, and joint_tensor_value correspond to Q, K, and V derived from the entire text sequence. The joint_strategy parameter takes values of either `"front"` or `"rear"`, indicating whether the text is concatenated to the front or rear of the image sequence, respectively.

To incorporate USP, we introduce a novel class, `xDiTCogVideoAttentionProcessor`. The primary distinction in its `__call__` function, as opposed to the original method, lies in the attention computation step, as illustrated below:

```diff
def __init__(self):
    ...
+   self.hybrid_seq_parallel_attn = xFuserLongContextAttention()

def __call__(...):
    ...
-   hidden_states = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(
-       query, key, value, dropout_p=0.0, is_causal=False
-   )
-   hidden_states = hidden_states.transpose(1, 2).reshape(
-       batch_size, -1, attn.heads * head_dim
-   )
+   # split the text and image part of the combined sequence
+   encoder_query = query[:, :, :text_seq_length, :]
+   query = query[:, :, text_seq_length:, :]
+   encoder_key = key[:, :, :text_seq_length, :]
+   key = key[:, :, text_seq_length:, :]
+   encoder_value = value[:, :, :text_seq_length, :]
+   value = value[:, :, text_seq_length:, :]
+   query = query.transpose(1, 2)
+   key = key.transpose(1, 2)
+   value = value.transpose(1, 2)
+   encoder_query = encoder_query.transpose(1, 2)
+   encoder_key = encoder_key.transpose(1, 2)
+   encoder_value = encoder_value.transpose(1, 2)
+
+   # pass the `Q`, `K`, and `V` of the image and text sequence
+   hidden_states = self.hybrid_seq_parallel_attn(
+       None, query, key, value, dropout_p=0.0, causal=False,
+       joint_tensor_query=encoder_query,
+       joint_tensor_key=encoder_key,
+       joint_tensor_value=encoder_value,
+       joint_strategy="front",
+   )
+   hidden_states = hidden_states.reshape(
+       batch_size, -1, attn.heads * head_dim
+   )
```

Lastly, to incorporate our `xDiTCogVideoAttentionProcessor` into the forward operation instead of the original `CogVideoXAttnProcessor2_0`, we iterate through each transformer block and update its attention processor. Prior to `output = original_forward...`, we include the following line to ensure that each attention block utilizes our processor:

```python
for block in transformer.transformer_blocks:
    block.attn1.processor = xDiTCogVideoAttentionProcessor()
```

## 4. Adapting Positional Embeddings for Parallelism in CogVideoX

As in [previous tutorial](adding_model_usp.md#1-initialization), we need to modify the original patch_embed layer. The new forward function performs the following steps:

- Merge the text and image sequence by the `all_gather` operation to ensure every GPU obtains the complete text and image sequences;
- Apply the original `transformer.patch_embed` operation to the entire sequence on each GPU; and
- Segment the text and image sequences identically to before. 

However, since the image sequence is partitioned but the text sequence is not. we only merge and segment the image sequence at the first and third step.

```python
original_patch_embed_forward = transformer.patch_embed.forward

@functools.wraps(transformer.patch_embed.__class__.forward)
def new_patch_embed(
    self, text_embeds: torch.Tensor, image_embeds: torch.Tensor
):
    # Step 1: merge the text and image sequence 
    image_embeds = get_sp_group().all_gather(image_embeds.contiguous(), dim=-2)
    batch, embed_height, embed_width = image_embeds.shape[0], image_embeds.shape[-2] // 2, image_embeds.shape[-1] // 2
    text_len = text_embeds.shape[-2]
    
    # Step 2: apply the original patch_embed
    output = original_patch_embed_forward(text_embeds, image_embeds)

    # Step 3: segment the text and image sequences
    text_embeds = output[:,:text_len,:]
    image_embeds = output[:,text_len:,:].reshape(batch, -1, embed_height, embed_width, output.shape[-1])

    image_embeds = torch.chunk(image_embeds, get_sequence_parallel_world_size(),dim=-3)[get_sequence_parallel_rank()]
    image_embeds = image_embeds.reshape(batch, -1, image_embeds.shape[-1])
    return torch.cat([text_embeds, image_embeds], dim=1)

new_patch_embed = new_patch_embed.__get__(transformer.patch_embed)
transformer.patch_embed.forward = new_patch_embed
```
